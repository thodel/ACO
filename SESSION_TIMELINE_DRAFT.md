# Session-by-Session Council Timeline (Draft from Available Data)

This is a **minimal first draft** built only from data already present in this
repository. It is **not yet a session-by-session timeline**; it only includes
the few dated anchors that are explicitly attested in the current files.

For open gaps and missing data, see:
- `/Users/TH_1/Documents/Repo/ACO/SESSION_TIMELINE_UNCERTAINTIES.md`

## Draft Timeline Anchors

| Date (Julian) | Event | Evidence in repo | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 430-11-19 | Imperial *sacra* convokes a synod in Ephesus for the following year’s Pentecost. | Doc 42 (CV25). Datierung in `/Users/TH_1/Documents/Repo/ACO/src/lib/data/aco-metadata.json` (entry: “Dok. 42 <em>Sacra</em> ...”) and full text in `/Users/TH_1/Documents/Repo/ACO/data_processing/input-dir/42_CV25.xml`. | Convocation, not a session. |
| 431-06-07 | Planned opening date (Pentecost) for the synod in Ephesus. | Footnote in `/Users/TH_1/Documents/Repo/ACO/data_processing/input-dir/42_CV25.xml` explains Pentecost date as 7 June 431. | Planned date; not evidence of actual session opening. |

## Known Missing Pieces (Blocking Session-by-Session View)
- A complete list of sessions with exact dates.
- Session numbering scheme with edition mapping.
- Document-to-session mapping.
- Attendance lists and outcomes per session.

If you can provide a session list (even a rough one), I can turn this into a
proper session-by-session timeline JSON and wire it into a visualization page.
